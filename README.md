## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### 🔹 Base Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

### 🔹 Meta Model
- Logistic Regression  

Predictions from all base models are used as inputs to the **meta-model**, which produces the final loan approval decision.
